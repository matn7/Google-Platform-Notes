Benefits include isolation of cloud resources, scalable and flexible networking options, and integration with GCP services 
for a seamless cloud environment.

8) How does GCP manage identity and access?
Answer: GCP manages identity and access through Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM). IAM allows administrators 
to authorize who can take action on specific resources, giving them control over which users and services can access 
different resources. IAM policies define permissions and can be set at various levels in the GCP resource hierarchy.

9) What is the role of Kubernetes Engine in GCP?
Answer: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed environment in GCP for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized 
applications using Google infrastructure. GKE automates many aspects of setting up and maintaining Kubernetes clusters, 
making it easier to deploy applications, scale them as needed, and manage their lifecycle without deep Kubernetes expertise.

10)  Explain the concept of serverless computing in GCP. Mention some serverless products offered by GCP.
Answer: Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications and services without managing infrastructure. 
Your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by GCP. This model enables developers 
to focus on their code while GCP handles scaling, provisioning, and managing servers. Examples of serverless products 
in GCP include Google Cloud Functions (event-driven functions), Google App Engine (application platform), 
and Google Cloud Run (containerized applications).

- Data center:
    - Physical or virtualized hardware
    - VMWare ESXi
    - Hyper-V
    - KVM
    - XEN
- AWS:
    - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.
- GCP:
    - Compute Engine    

**On-premises vs. Google Cloud: Storage**

- Data center:
    - Active Directory
    - LDAP
- AWS:
    - Amazon IAM
- Google Cloud:
    - Cloud Identity
    - IAM        

### Google Cloud Platform resource hierarchy

**Resource hierarchy levels define trust boundaries**

- Group your resources according to your organization structure.
- Levels of the hierarchy provide trust boundaries and resource isolation.

**All GCP services you use are associated with a Project**

- Track resource and quota usage.
- Enable billing.
- Manage permissions and credentials.
- Enable services and APIs.
- Separate administrative control plane.

**Projects have three identifying attributes**

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project ID | Globally Unique | Chosen by you | Immutable |
| Project name | Need not be unique | Chosen by you | Mutable |
| Project number | Globally unique | Assigned by GCP | Immutable |

**Folders offer flexible management**

- Folders group projects under an organization.
- Folders can contain projects, other folders, or both.
- Use folders to assign policies.

**The organization node organizes projects**

- The organization node is the root node for Google Cloud resources.
- Notable organization roles:
    - **Organization Policy Administrator:** Broad control over all cloud resources.
    - **Project Creator:** Fine-grained control of project creation.

**An example IAM resource hierarchy**

- A policy is set on a resource:
    - Each policy contains a set of roles and role members.
- Resources inherit policies from parent:
    - Resource policies are a union of parent and resource.    
- A less restrictive parent policy overrides a more restrictive resource policy.

#### Quiz

**1. True or False: All Google Cloud resources are associated with a project.**

- True. All Google Cloud resources are associated with a project. Each project is associated with a billing account, 
which functions as the payment method for these resources.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**Shared Responsibilities Model**

- Google is responsible for managing its infrastructure security.
- You are responsible for securing your data.
- Google helps you with best practices, templates, products, and solutions.

**Identity and Access Management**

- Who
- can do what
- on which resource

**Who: IAM policies can apply to any of four types of principals**

- Google account: test@gmail.com
- Service account: test@project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- Google group: test@googlegroups.com
- Cloud Identity: example.com

**Can do what: IAM roles are collections of related permissions**

- Basic
- Predefined
- Custom

**IAM basic roles apply across all Google Cloud services in a project**

- can do what on all resources.

**IAM basic roles offer fixed, coarse-grained levels of access**

- Owner:
    - Invite members
    - Remove members
    - Delete projects
- Editor:
    - Deploy applications
    - Modify code
    - Configure services
- Viewer:
    - Read-only access
- Billing Administrator:
    - Manage billing
    - Add and remove administrators
- Project can have multiple owners, editors, viewers, and billing administrators.                

**IAM predefined roles apply to a particular Google Cloud service in a project**

- can do what on Compute Engine resources in this project, or folder, or org.

**IAM predefined roles offer more fine-grained permissions on particular services**

- Google Group:
    - InstanceAdmin Role:
        - compute.instances.delete
        - compute.instances.get
        - compute.instances.list
        - compute.instances.setMachineType
        - compute.instances.start
        - compute.instances.stop
        
**Compute Engine IAM roles**

| Role Title | Description |
|---|---|
| Compute Admin | Full control of all Compute Engine resources (compute.*) |
| Network Admin | Permissions to create, modify, and delete networking resources, except for firewall rules and SSL certs. |
| Storage Admin | Permissions to create, modify, and delete disks, images, and snapshots. |

**IAM custom roles let you define a precise set of permissions**

- Google Group:
    - InstanceOperator Role:
        - compute.instances.get
        - compute.instances.list
        - compute.instances.start
        - compute.instances.stop
        - ...

**On which resource: Users get roles on specific items in the hierarchy**

- on which resource

**Service accounts provide an identity for carrying out server-to-server interactions**

- Programs running within Compute Engine instances can automatically acquire access tokens with credentials.
- Tokens are used to access any service API in your project and any other services that granted access to that service
account.
- Service accounts are convenient when you're not accessing used data.

#### Quiz

**1. True or False: If a Google Cloud IAM policy gives you Owner permissions at the project level, 
your access to a resource in the project may be restricted by a more restrictive policy on that resource.**

- False. Policies are a union of the parent and the resource. If a parent policy is less restrictive, 
it overrides a more restrictive resource policy.

**2. Service accounts are used to provide which of the following?**

- Authentication between Google Cloud services.
- Key generation and rotation when used with App Engine and Compute Engine.
- A way to restrict the actions that a resource (such as a VM) can perform.
- A way to allow users to act with service account permissions.

### Identity

- Gmail account, Cloud Identity/Google Workspace, Service Account: 
    - Can be part of a group.
        - User@gmail.com, Project A, Owner
        - User@yourcompany.com, Project B, Instance Admin
- Note: You cannot use Cloud IAM to create or manage your users or groups.

**What if you already have a different corporate directory?**

```
Users and groups in your        Google Cloud Directory Sync
existing directory service      ----- Scheduled sync ----->     Users and groups in your Cloud Identity domain.
```

### Interacting with Google Cloud Platform

**There are four ways to interact with GCP**

| Cloud Platform Console | Cloud SDK and Cloud Shell | Cloud Console Mobile App | REST-based API |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web user interface | Command-line interface | For IOS and Android | For custom applications |

**Google Cloud Console**

- Centralized GUI-based console for all project data.
- Developer tools:
    - Cloud Source Respositories.
    - Cloud Shell.
    - Test Lab (mobile app testing).
- Access to product APIs.
- Manage and create projects.    

**The Cloud SDK and Cloud Shell**

- The Cloud SDK includes CLI tools for Google Cloud products and services:
    - gcloud, gsutil (Cloud Storage), bg (Big Query).
- Available as Docker image.
- Available via Cloud Shell:
    - Centralized version of the Cloud SDK on Compute Engine instance.    

**RESTful APIs**

- Programmatic access to products and services:
    - Typically use JSON as an interchange format.
    - Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization.
- Enabled through the Google Cloud Platform Console.
- To help you control spend, most include daily quotas and rates (limits):
    - Quotas and rates can be raised by request.    

**Cloud Console Mobile App**

- Manage virtual machines and database instances.
- Manage apps in Google App Engine.
- Manage your billing.
- Virtualize your projects with a customizable dashboard.

### Billing, labels, and quotas

**Resource Manager lets you hierarchically manage resources**

- **Billing and Resource Monitoring**:
    - Organization contains all billing accounts.
    - Project is associated with one billing account.
    - A resource belongs to one and only one project.
- **Identity and Access Management**:
    - Child policies cannot restrict access granted at the parent level.

**Resource quotas**

- Quotas **provide protection** against:
    - Cost overruns.
        - Can be indicators of bad code.
    - Other poorly behaved GCP customers.
- **Default quotas** may **increase as your use** of Google Cloud Platform expands over time.
- Most quotas are applied **per project**, based on **resource type and allocation**.             

**Why use Project quotas?**

- Prevent runaway consumption in case of an error or malicious attack.
- Prevent billing spikes or surprises.
- Forces sizing consideration and periodic review.

**Estimate costs with the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator**

**Budgets and email alerts**

**Labels are a utility for organizing GCP resources**

- Attached to resources: VM, disk, snapshot, image:
    - GCP Console, gcloud, or API.
- Example uses of labels:
    - Inventory.
    - Filter resources.
    - In scripts:
        - Help analyze costs.
        - Run bulk operations.    

**Use labels for ...**

- Team or Cost Center.
    - `team:marketing`
    - `team:research`
- Components:
    - `component:redis`
    - `component:frontend`
- Environment or stage:
    - `environment:prod`
    - `environment:test`
- Owner or contact:
    - `owner:gaurav`
    - `contact:opm`
- State:
    - `state:inuse`
    - `state:readyfordelete`

- Zone: europe-west2-a, europe-west2-b, europe-west2-c 

**Spreading resources across zones in a region**

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network

**Projects and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network**

**VPC regional subnets**

**3 VPC Network Types**

- Default:
    - Every project
    - One subnet per region
    - Default firewall rules
- Auto Mode:
    - Default network
    - One subnet per region
    - Regional IP allocation

**Firewall rules**

- VPC network functions as distributed firewall.
- Can use tags to globally apply rules.
- Firewall rules are stateful.
- Implied deny all ingress and allow all egress.

**A firewall rule is composed of...**

- `direction`:
    - Inbound connections are matched against `ingress` rules only.
    - Outbound connections are matched against `egress` rules only.
- `source or destination`:
    - For the `ingress` direction, `sources` can be specified as part of the rule with IP addresses, source tags, or a
    source service account.
    - For the `egress` direction, `destinations` can be specified as part of the rule with one or more ranges of 
    IP addresses.
- `protocol` and `port`:
    - Any rule can be restricted to apply to specific protocols only or specific combinations of protocols and ports only.
- `action`:
    - To allow or deny packets that match the direction, protocol, port, and source or destination of the rule.
- `priority`:
    - Governs the order in which rules are evaluated; the first matching rule is applied.

### Compute Engine Virtual Machines

**Compute Engine Features**

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
- No upfornt cost.
- Customizable and flexible.
- Fast startup time.

**VMs can have internal and external IP addresses**

**Internal IP**

- Allocated from subnet range to VMs by DHCP.
- DHCP lease is renewed every 24 hours.
- VM name + IP is registered with network-scoped DNS.

**External IP**

- Assigned from pool (ephemeral).
- Reserved (static).
- Billed when not attached to a running VM.
- VM doesn't know external IP; it is mapped to the internal IP.

**Standard machine types**

```
3.75 GB of memory
-----------------
    1 vCPU
```

**High-memory machine types**
